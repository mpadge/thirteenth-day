O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees
O hear the Angels voices.
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night divine
O night divine.
