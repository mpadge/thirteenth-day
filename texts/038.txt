We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.

Good tidings we bring for you and your kin,
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year.

O bring us some figgy pudding
O bring us some figgy pudding
O bring us some figgy pudding
and bring it right here.

And we won't go until we've got some
And we won't go until we've got some
And we won't go until we've got some
so bring some out here.

It's a season for music
It's a season for music
It's a season for music
and a time of good Cheer.
