Dashing through the snow,
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun
It is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, Hey!
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd took a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortuned seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And we got upsot

Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun
It is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, Hey!
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day of two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed a there I sprawling lie
But quickly drove away

Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun
It is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, Hey!
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
