Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring-ting-tingling too,
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.


Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, just holding your hand,
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.


Our cheeks are nice and rosy,
And comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be,
Let's take that road before us,
And sing a chorus or two,
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.


There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray,
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day,
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop,
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!


There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy,
When they pass around the chocolate
And the pumpkin pie,
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives,
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring-ting-tingling too,
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.


Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, just holding your hand,
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.

Let's take that road before us

For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Whoa!
