Mary, did you Know? By Christmas Carolsmary, did you know
That your baby boy will one
Day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will save
Our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has
Come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give
Sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will calm a
Storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has
Walked where angels trod?

And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God

Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is
Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one
Day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is
Heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I am

Oh Mary did you know?
