Joy to the world! The Lord is come:
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns:
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground:
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found.

He rules the earth with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousnes
And wonders of his love
