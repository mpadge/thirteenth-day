I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep;
She thought that I was tucked
Up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then
I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white;
Oh
What a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
