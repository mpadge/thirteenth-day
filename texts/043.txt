I want my arms around you for Christmas
I need no presents under the tree
You're all I want, my darling
And that will be the world to me.

I want to share your kisses for Christmas
The rest is only tinsel and show
You're all I want, my darling
At candle glow and mistletoe.

As far as I'm concerned
Santa doesn't have to load his sleigh
He can mark my other gifts 'returned'
Or give them all away.

I only want your lovin' for Christmas
No other kind of present will do
You're all I want, my darling
Please want me too
Please want me too
Please want me too
As I want you.
