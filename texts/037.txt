We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin,
We wish you a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
And bring some out here

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin,
We wish you a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

For we all like figgy pudding
We all like figgy pudding
We all like figgy pudding
So bring some out here

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin,
We wish you a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

And we won't go until we've got some
We won't go until we've got some
We won't go until we've got some
So bring some out here

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin,
We wish you a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
